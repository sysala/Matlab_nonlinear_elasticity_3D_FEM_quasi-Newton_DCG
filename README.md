# Matlab_nonlinear_elasticity_3D_FEM_quasi-Newton_DCG

This program compares Newton and quasi-Newton methods for various nonlinear elastic models in 3D. It is considered the strip-footing benchmark. One can set optionally 2 types of finite elements, different levels of mesh density and many other parameters and inner solvers. More details can be found in the paper J. Karatson, S. Sysala. M. Beres:  Quasi-Newton variable preconditioning for nonlinear elasticity systems in 3D, 2023. These codes arise from the codes on elasto-plasticity available at https://github.com/matlabfem/matlab_fem_elastoplasticity
